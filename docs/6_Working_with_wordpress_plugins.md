## Working with wordpress plugins

Working with WordPress plugins follow the same rules than working with themes. 

You can use a [boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) to speed up the plugin development.

Plugins reside in *wp-content/plugins* folder, as opposite to themes, that reside in *wp-content/themes*. This is the main difference, excluding this difference, the ideas are the same than explained in tutorials 4 and 5.
